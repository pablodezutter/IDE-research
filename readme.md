It is really difficult to choose because I don't have any experience with this programs.

* https://atom.io/

# Positives: 
- Has integration with Git. Projects are automatically synchronized with the Git 
repository.
- Nice looking 'flight-manual': very important
- Flexible

- Needs a lot of resources

NÂ° 1 reason why i choose Atom: it's free
